### How do I report an issue or request a feature?

We made it super simple to report any problems or feature requests. Follow these steps:

1. **Go to the "Issues" tab**: At the top of this page, you'll see a tab called **Issues**. Click on it.
    
2. **Click the "New Issue" button**: This button is located on the right-hand side of the page.
    
3. **Fill out the Issue form**:
    
    - **Title**: Give a short and clear title for your issue.
    - **Description**: Describe what the issue is. Try to be as detailed as possible. Here are some examples of what you can report:
        - A **bug** or problem with the project.
        - A **feature request**: Something you would like the project to have.
        - **Help wanted**: If you need assistance with something or don't know how to use a feature.
    
    **Example Issue:**
    
    - **Title**: "App crashes when I try to open the settings"
    - **Description**: "I open the settings page, and the app crashes every time. This happens on my Android phone, version 1.2.3. It worked fine on version 1.1."
4. **Submit your issue**: Once you've written the issue, click **Submit new issue**.
    

### What happens after I submit an issue?

Once you submit your issue, here's what happens next:

1. **Labeling the issue**: We will label your issue based on its type (e.g., bug, feature request, help wanted).
    - **Bug**: There is an error or problem.
    - **Feature Request**: You’re asking for a new feature or improvement.
    - **Help Wanted**: You need help with something, or you need assistance.
    - **In Progress**: This means someone is already working on fixing or completing it.
2. **Review and Fix**: Our developers will look into the issue, and if they need more information, they may comment back to ask for clarification.
3. **Progress Updates**: We will update you when the issue is fixed or if we need more help.

### Types of Issues

Here’s how different types of issues will be handled:

- **Bug**: A bug is something that isn't working as expected. For example, if a feature crashes or something is broken, you can create a bug report.
- **Feature Request**: If you think of a new feature or improvement, you can suggest it here.
- **Help Wanted**: If you're unsure about something or need assistance using the project, feel free to ask for help.
- **In Progress**: If someone is actively working on fixing the issue, it will be marked as "In Progress."

### What if I don’t know how to use Markdown?

Don’t worry! You don’t need to know Markdown to report an issue. Simply fill in the title and description, and provide any information that might help us understand your issue better.

If you don’t know how to format the description, don’t stress — just type as you would in any regular text editor!

### How can I track the status of my issue?

When issues are reported, they go through these stages:

4. **New**: The issue has been reported but not yet worked on.
5. **In Progress**: Someone is working on the issue.
6. **Resolved**: The issue has been fixed or completed.
7. **Closed**: The issue is no longer active.
